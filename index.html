<!-- tip#1 you always needs to setup your boiler plate on your file. Per earlier tutorial, i use html:5 boiler plate for html to get the below docstyle
 and base structure -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>my website "tag" name here</title>
    <!-- You want to ensure that you link your CSS file to your HTML file by using the below code:
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">  link rel with always be style sheet for CSS and href value must be your .css filename -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<!-- My webpage code must be contained between the body tags, no matter what -->
<body>
    <!-- One of the first stylistic methods i learned what to showcase a big title with a background image. you can go something like
     
    <div class="class_name">  my class_name info is important because i will use it in my CSS file to style this div
        <h1>My title text here</h1>
    </div>
    Example below: -->
    <div class="header">
        <h1>Road Stories in h1</h1>
    </div>
    <!-- Next, i learned to shape some website sections-->
    <div>
        <!-- This will have a Title box, a PIC, a header, standard P field & formated P field-->
        <h2 class="section1box">Section 1 Box Text Here (2 styles input) in h2</h2>
        <img id="samplepic" src="images/examplegif.gif" alt="example">
        <h3>Section 1 header in h3 format</h3>
        <p>Section 1 text classic field in standard p text.</p><p class="coolwords">This is a paragrah example with several arguments such as bold and italic</p>
    </div>

    
</body>
